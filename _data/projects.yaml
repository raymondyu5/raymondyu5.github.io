    description: "I've always wanted to have insane dancing skills. Obviously I didn't end up as Kpop star, so I decided to make myself one (virtually). When Real2Sim2Real was all the rage, I had scanned in countless objects, but I had never tried scanning in humans. In this project, I scanned in a few of my friends, rigged the characters, and made them dance!"
